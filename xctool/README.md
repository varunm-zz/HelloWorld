__xctool__ is a replacement for Apple's __xcodebuild__ that makes it
easier to build and test iOS and Mac products.  It's especially helpful
for continuous integration.

## Features

__xctool__ is drop-in replacement for xcodebuild that adds a few extra
features:

* **Runs the same tests as Xcode.app.**

  Surprisingly, Apple's command-line _xcodebuild_ tool does not run your
product's tests the same way as _Xcode.app_.  xcodebuild doesn't
understand which targets in your scheme are test targets, which test
suites or cases you might have disabled in your scheme, or how to run
simulator-based, application tests.

  If you use [application
tests](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/developertools/Conceptual/UnitTesting/08-Glossary/glossary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002143-CH8-SW1),
you've probably seen xcodebuild skipping them with this message:
	
	```
	Skipping tests; the iPhoneSimulator platform does not currently support
	application-hosted tests (TEST_HOST set).
	```

  *xctool* fixes this - it looks at your Xcode scheme and is able to
reproduce the same test run you would get with Xcode.app via _Cmd-U_ or 
_Product &rarr; Test_, including running application tests that require
the iOS simulator.

* **Structured output of build and test results.**

  _xctool_ captures all build events and test results as structured JSON
objects.  If you're building a continous integration system, this means
you don't have to regex parse _xcodebuild_ output anymore.

  Try one of the [Reporters](#reporters) to customize the output or get
the full event stream with the `-reporter json-stream` option.

* **Human-friendly, ANSI-colored output.**

  _xcodebuild_ is incredibly verbose, printing the full compile command
and output for every source file.  By default, _xctool_ is only verbose
if something goes wrong, making it much easier to identify where the
problems are.

  Example:

## Requirements

You'll need Xcode's Command Line Tools installed.  From Xcode, install
via _Xcode &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Downloads_.

## Usage

xctool's commands and options are mostly a superset of xcodebuild's.  In
most cases, you can just swap __xcodebuild__ with __xctool__ and things will
run as expected but with more attractive output.

You can always get help and a full list of options with:

```
path/to/xctool.sh -help
```

### Building

Building products with _xctool_ is the same as building them with
_xcodebuild_.

If you use workspaces and schemes:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  build
```

If you use projects and schemes:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -project YourProject.xcodeproj \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  build
```

All of the common options like `-configuration`, `-sdk`, `-arch` work
just as they do with _xcodebuild_.

NOTE: _xctool_ doesn't support directly building targets using
`-target`; you must use schemes.

### Testing

_xctool_ has a __test__ action which knows how to build and run the
tests in your scheme.  You can optionally limit what tests are run
or change the SDK they're run against.

To build and run all tests in your scheme, you would use:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  test
```

To build and run just the tests in a specific target, use the `-only` option:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  test -only SomeTestTarget
```

You can go further and just run a specific test class:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  test -only SomeTestTarget:SomeTestClass
```

Or, even further and run just a single test method:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  test -only SomeTestTarget:SomeTestClass/testSomeMethod
```

You can also run tests against a different SDK:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  test -test-sdk iphonesimulator5.1
```

#### Building Tests

While __test__ will build and run your tests, sometimes you want to
build them without running them.  For that, use __build-tests__.

For example:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  build-tests
```

You can optionally just build a single test target with the `-only` option:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  build-tests -only SomeTestTarget
```

#### Running Tests

If you've already built tests with __build-tests__, you can use
__run-tests__ to run them.  This is helpful if you want to build tests
once but run them against multiple SDKs.

To run all tests, you would use:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  run-tests
```

Just as with the __test__ action, you can limit which tests are run with
the `-only`.  And, you can change which SDK they're run against
with the `-test-sdk`.

## Continuous Integration

xctool is an excellent choice for running your tests under a continuous
integration server such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).
In order to your run your tests within a continuous integration environment,
you must create **Shared Schemes** for your application target and ensure that all dependencies (such as CocoaPods) are added explicitly to the Scheme. To do so:

1. Open up the **Manage Schemes** sheet by selecting the **Product** menu > **Schemes** > **Manage Schemes...**
1. Locate your application target in the list. Ensure that the **Shared** checkbox in far right hand column of the sheet is checked.
1. If your application or test targets include cross-project dependencies such as CocoaPods, then you will need to ensure that they have been
configured as explicit dependencies. To do so:
    1. Highlight your application target and hit the **Edit...** button to open the Scheme editing sheet.
    1. Click the **Build** tab in the left-hand panel of the Scheme editor.
    1. Click the **+** button and add each dependency to the project. CocoaPods will appears as static library named **Pods**.
    1. Drag the dependency above your application target so that it is built first.

You will now have a new file in the **xcshareddata/xcschemes** directory underneath your Xcode project. This is the
shared Scheme that you just configured. Check this file into your repository and xctool will be able to find and execute
your tests on the next CI build.

### Example Travis CI Configuration

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a very popular continuous integration system offered for free to Open Source projects.
It integrates well with Github and is easy to configure. Once you have set up your shared Scheme for use with xctool, you will
need to configure a `.travis.yml` file. To make it a bit easier to get started with Travis, you may want to base your
script off of the following example:

```
yml
language: objective-c
before_install:
    - brew update
    - brew install xctool --HEAD
script: xctool -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace -scheme 'MyApp' test
```

You will obviously need to replace 'MyApp.xcworkspace' and 'MyApp' with the name of your project and shared Xcode scheme, respectively.

You can learn more about the Travis CI environment for iOS and OS X application by referring to the
[About OS X Travis CI Environment](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/osx-ci-environment/) document and find in-depth documentation for
configuring your project by consulting the [Getting Started](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/) page.

## Reporters

xctool has reporters that output build and test results in different
formats.  By default, _xctool_ always uses the `pretty` reporter.

You can change or add reporters with the `-reporter` option:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  -reporter plain \
  build
```

By default, reporters output to standard out, but you can also direct
the output to a file by adding `:OUTPUT_PATH` after the reporter name:

```
path/to/xctool.sh \
  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  -reporter plain:/path/to/plain-output.txt \
  build
```

### Included Reporters

* __pretty__: a text-based reporter that uses ANSI colors and unicode
symbols for pretty output (the default).
* __plain__: like _pretty_, but with with no colors or unicode.
* __phabricator__: outputs a JSON array of build/test results which can
be fed into the [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org/) code-review tool.
* __junit__: produces a JUnit/xUnit compatible XML file with test
results.
* __json-stream__: a stream of build/test events as JSON dictionaries,
one per line [(example
output)](https://gist.github.com/fpotter/82ffcc3d9a49d10ee41b).
* __json-compilation-database__: outputs a [JSON Compilation Database](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) of build events which can be used by [Clang Tooling](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html) based tools, e.g. [OCLint](http://oclint.org).

You could also __add your own__ Reporter - see
[Reporter.h](https://github.com/facebook/xctool/blob/master/xctool/xctool/Reporter.h).

## Configuration (.xctool-args)

If you routinely need to pass many arguments to _xctool_ on the
command-line, you can use an __.xctool-args__ file to speed up your workflow.
If _xctool_ finds an __.xctool-args__ file in the current directory, it
will automatically pre-populate its arguments from there.

The format is just a JSON array of arguments:

```
[
  "-workspace", "YourWorkspace.xcworkspace",
  "-scheme", "YourScheme",
  "-configuration", "Debug",
  "-sdk", "iphonesimulator",
  "-arch", "i386"
]
```

Any extra arguments you pass on the command-line will take precendence
over those in the _.xctool-args_ file.

## Contributing

Bug fixes, improvements, and especially new
[Reporter](https://github.com/facebook/xctool/blob/master/xctool/xctool/Reporter.h)
implementations are welcome.  Before submitting a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), please
be sure to sign the [Facebook
Contributor License
Agreement](https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/cla).  We can't
accept pull requests unless it's been signed.

#### Workflow 

1. Fork.
2. Make a feature branch: __git checkout -b my-feature__
3. Make your feature.  Keep things tidy so you have one commit per self
   contained change (squashing can help).
3. Push your branch to your fork: __git push -u origin my-feature__
4. Open GitHub, under "Your recently pushed branches", click __Pull
   Request__ for _my-feature_.

Be sure to use a separate feature branch and pull request for every
self-contained feature.  If you need to make changes from feedback, make
the changes in place rather than layering on commits (use interactive
rebase to edit your earlier commits).  Then use __git push --force
origin my-feature__ to update your pull request.

#### Workflow (for Facebook people, other committers)

Mostly the same, but use branches in the main xctool repo if you prefer.
It's a nice way to keep things together.

1. Make a feature branch: __git checkout -b myusername/my-feature__
2. Push your branch: __git push -u origin myusername/my-feature__
3. Open GitHub to [facebook/xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool),
   under "Your recently pushed branches", click __Pull Request__ for
   _myusername/my-feature_.

## Known Issues

* **_Find Implicit Dependencies_ is not supported.**  If you get unexplained
linker or compile errors in xctool but not in Xcode, it might be this.
Xcode.app has a mode where it will try to infer dependencies between
your projects and make sure dependent projects are built first.
Unfortunately it looks like this logic only exists in Xcode.app.  The
workaround is to setup correct _Target Dependencies_ or to add the
necessary targets to your scheme ahead of the targets that require them.
